<h1>Welcome to Data 505 Homework Submissions</h1>
<p>
  I will post links to my submissions as often as possible. I am considering adding other projects to this page as well. The primary purpose of
  this page is to not only force myself to practice HTML on the side. It is also to help me showcase work I do in the future to add to my CV. Enjoy!
